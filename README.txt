1       Introduction
The multi-agency collaboration refers to the role of police forces in investigation and 
partner agencies in protecting the rights of victims of crimes particularly women and children 
because of fear and shame to report the crime to the police stations. This leads to abuse of 
their rights and stay with life time problems that may lead to diseases, death and sometimes 
disabilities. Those partner agencies particularly NGO's and Local authorities participate by 
indictment of the victim’s crimes, since; those issues after being reported to the police are 
shared to partner agencies named, so that they can protect them with their rights and after, 
they legally have their right to participate in all proceeding steps until they meet victims’ 
rights. The process of indictment done by Local Authorities and NGOs is done manually leads to 
spend more days for the victims to get deputies who might stands for their rights, sometimes 
the delay of information on time may results to victims being abused for their rights. Here is 
the project that will solve the described challenge.



1.2       Background of the problem
It is expected that the government of Tanzania with its assistance or related power and 
decision departments to stand on the side of its citizens to give them better life, peace and 
supportive environment to make sure they engage in social and economic development. The fact is,
there is some areas that citizens especially women and children still have no voice to be 
considered and listens that’s why women and children crime issues still fall out. They have fear
and shame sometimes fells that they do not deserve being upon. “We noted earlier the functions 
of the police force. In practical terms, it may be said to be the duty of the police within the 
context of maintaining law and order to prevent the commission of offences, to apprehend those 
believed to be committing, about to commit, or to have committed offences with the object of bringing 
them to justice (Laurean Mutahunwa Tibasana)”. 
By referring the context of how Tanzania police force works on dealing and preventing crimes in the 
administration of the Police Force the Inspector General is assisted by four commissioners; heading the 
department of administration and finance, Operations and Training, Criminal Investigation and commanding 
police force deployed in Zanzibar. 
For the reason above, we come up with this solution to integrate the roles of Local Authorities and 
the NGO’s on protecting the rights of victims on the relation of Police forces on investigation 
of the crimes.   




1.3       Problem statement
Due to the fear and shame that women and children as the common victim have in reporting 
faced sexual assault crime issues, they fail to report those issues to the stations. We are going to develop a crime 
indictment system so as to integrate the roles of non-police forces and police forces in solving 
the problem whereas non-police forces will indict so as to assist victims in solving their issue.

1.4       Objectives
1.4.1    Main objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a multi-agency collaboration system on crime indictment.

1.4.2    Specific objectives
1.	To design user interface.
2.	To create database system
3.	To integrate database system and user interface
4.	To test system

1.5       Scope and Limitations of proposed system
1.5.1    Scope
The project will be done to the level of prototyping.
1.5.2     Limitations
1.	The system requires internet access to use


2.4       Proposed system
The system proposed targets to create easy interaction between non police 
forces and victims of crime after complaints report sent to the court. The system will 
help them to apply for deputies of victims to protect their rights since it’s their role.


2.4.1    Feature Modules of proposed system
1.	User interface
This module provides the friendly approach to the system that Police and 
non-police forces both access it.
2.	Database
This module provides the storage of every confirmed data.
3.	NGOs and Local Authority Module
The module provides non-police forces the interface to report crime and apply 
for the indictment 
4.	Police force Module
The module for the confirmation of every data and confirm indictment process of 
non-police forces
